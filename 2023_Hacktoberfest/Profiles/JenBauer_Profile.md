# Jen Bauer's Profile
## Bio
Jen Bauer is a lifelong technologist, builder, data storyteller, and educator.  She is currently a QA Engineer at Hungryroot, where she delights in challenging internal APIs with Postman while building automated test suites.  You may have seen her completing API testing challenges (Ministry of Testing‚Äôs Test.bash(); 2022 or 30 Days of Postman for Developers), attending conferences, or otherwise sharing her tips and tricks about Postman, SQL, and spreadsheets.  When she is not exploring what‚Äôs up next in the world of tech, she enjoys playing and collecting video games across Nintendo consoles (spanning the Famicom to the Switch and all those in between) and delights in sharing these with her daughter, husband, cats, and good friends.

## Skills and Specialties
- **Finding the bugs and the bugs finding me**, whether I am trying to seek them out or not.  I find them at work, or when signing up for a service appointment for my car, or on websites when creating a new account.  I have always had a knack for finding issues with user flows throughout my years in tech.
- **API Testing**, in particular with REST frameworks.  Tools used include Postman, Network traffic monitoring in-browser, Charles Proxy, and trying new tools as they appear.
- **Documentation**, whether it is process docs, technical docs, or onboarding for those who come after me.  This is what I do and what I have done across roles.
- **Sharing knowledge through teaching or hosted sessions**, either through topics that I talk through, or my favorite - interactive workshops that I set up that allow my students to play with content while I teach them topics.  See my [‚úàÔ∏è Postman Sightseeing Tour üß≠](https://jenbauer.notion.site/Postman-Sightseeing-Tour-173d7fad161d473c8af99d2d916963a7?pvs=4) for the latest example of this.

## A Little About Me: Fun Fact
I noted this earlier: I am video game collector.  I have a lot of Nintendo consoles.  My favorite console is a Famicom that I snuck back home from my honeymoon in Japan in my laundry.  It has faded maroon and white plastic and is precious.

## What I Learned About Recently or Recently Completed Projects
I'm working on setting up more projects for Hacktoberfest right now during October of 2023!  This is keeping me busy for the next week or so. üòÖ
