# Kara's Readme File and Bio
## Bio
Hi! I'm Kara. I am one of the directors of the Greenville Women Who Code chapter. I have worked in some tech or tech adjacent field since 2008 in sales, tech support, marketing, QA, software development, and management. I'm currently the VP of Engineering for Bookshop.org. I love to mentor women and underrepresented minorities in tech, and I'm always open to network!

## Skills and Specialties
- I'm pretty skilled at [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) 👩🏽‍💻
- I'm really good at troubleshooting weird bugs in code (especially almost better if I _didn't_ write it myself 🐞)
- Awesome communicator - written, verbal, telepathic 🧠😆
- Adept researcher - no matter the source, I can find the answer 🕵🏽‍♀️
- I'm a really fast reader 💨 and a great cook (snuck 2 in one bullet point 🏆)

## A Little About Me: Fun Fact
 🎶 My superpower is knowing the lyrics, year, artist, and title of nearly every R&B, Pop, Alternative, and Rap song from ~1993 - ~2015 (then I discovered podcasts so I listened to way less music 🥹). This has so far proven to be a useless life skill.

## What I Learned About Recently or Recently Completed Projects
I don't love anything dealing with frontend development or design and have limited SVG experience, so I took this Hacktoberfest opportunity to make some SVGs from scratch and now I hate it 50% less 🎉

## What I'm Learning About Next or Any Upcoming Projects
I'm currently deciding what I want to do with AI🤖. I'm keeping up with changes in LLMs, generative AI, prompt engineering, and use cases.
