# Prayrana Khadye's Profile
## Bio
Happy Hacktober! ðŸŽƒ I am Prayrana (pronounced "Pray-na") and I am skilled in software testing for over 10 years and love to share my expertise in creative and fun ways.  I love learning new technologies and modern approaches to software.    

## Skills and Specialties
My specialties are --
- **Efficiency**  -- In all aspects of life -- whether writing, coding, testing, cooking.  Make things simple yet valuable.
- **Innovative**  -- OUT with the old and IN with the new!  Involve yourself in the community to learn these techniques.
- **Learning**  -- Advice from others -- Instead of learning every possible lanugage -- Just have an open mind to learn any language.

## A Little About Me: Fun Fact
I am a great listener and advocate for anyone teaching me something new.  I am also actively involved in DEFCON Greenville events and love learning hacking and how not to hack around a problem and to think of a permanent solution instead -- in code and real life.  

## What I Learned About Recently or Recently Completed Projects
I have recently learned how to use Selenium IDE, Applitools web extensions, and the ScreenPlay Design pattern in Automation.  These skills will stay with me for many years since they were extremely elegant and useful in the real-world!

## What I'm Learning About Next or Any Upcoming Projects
Just like Hacktoberfest -- I am creating a simple, fun Javascript based web project to teach anyone that has interest in QA fundamentals in a fun way!  Look forward to that near the end of November as I finalize the project.  I will be posting to HackGreenville and WWCodeGreenville for their review and feedback.
